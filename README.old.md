**Credit Card Verifier - Validify**

Validify is a simple, user-friendly React application designed to validate credit card numbers using the **Luhn Algorithm**. This project demonstrates core JavaScript concepts and React principles, offering an interactive and visually appealing UI for credit card verification.

### Features:
- **Real-Time Validation**: Users can input a credit card number and verify its validity with a single click.
- **Luhn Algorithm**: The backend logic ensures accurate validation of credit card numbers.
- **Verified List**: Stores previously checked credit card numbers, showing only the last four digits with a clear "VALID" or "NOT VALID" status.
- **Reset & Verify Again**: Allows users to restart the process and verify multiple credit card numbers.

### Purpose:
This project serves as a practical example of building an interactive front-end application with validation logic, making it a great starting point for learning about:
- Front-end development with React.
- Implementation of validation algorithms in JavaScript.
- State management and UI updates in modern web applications.

### How to Use:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Start the application with `npm start`.
4. Enter a credit card number in the input field and click **"Verify CC"** to check its validity.
5. Use the **"Verify New Credit Card"** button to clear the input and add the checked number to the list.
